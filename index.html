      <h2>Callie & Holly</h2>
      <p>Callie came to my family as a stray when she was about a year old. She was the first animal I really have core memories with. She was an avid mouser and loved exploring the outdoors. Callie remained a well-fed outdoor cat until, one day, she seemingly dropped all of her weight. I was five at the time and didn't really notice, but my parents did. A few weeks later, while doing yardwork, my mother noticed a tiny black and white face peering at her from a small hole in the door of a shed on our property. Behold, Callie had given birth to six kittens of varying colors and patterns. Out of this litter, we kept the runt, the lone other calico cat. I named her Holly because I loved the name and had heard my sister talk about one of her friends named Holly. (Unfortunatly, human Holly would later pass away. I befriended her daughter as adults and shared with her the story of how I inadvertently named a cat after her late mom.) Both cats have since crossed the rainbow bridge but they started my love for cats in general but especially calicos.</p>

      <h2>Nugget</h2>
      <p>In the winter of 2013, I was working at a retreat center in the Ozarks when the camp cat gave birth to yet another litter of kittens. This was a litter of three, all black jellybeans. Unfortunately, due to an extreme cold snap, only one kitten survived and her mother rejected her. I adopted her as my office mascot and named her Nugget. When I left the camp in 2014, Nugget came with me. Despite having been an indoor/outdoor cat for the first year and a half of her life, Nugget was more than content to become a fat, lazy house cat. Due to the trauma of her early kittenhood, Nugget is not easily trusting and has some anger issues. We've tried working them out but it usually ends in bloodshed. Approaching ten years old, Nugget is still content with being an only cat and lives with my parents where she enjoys yelling at them for food, snuggling with my dad, and tormenting my mom.</p>

      <h2>Accio</h2>
      <p>Sometime around September 2012, I noticed a very malnourished calico cat hanging around my parents' house. (This was a trend throughout the years, people dumping animals.) I commented to my dad that I had noticed the cat, and he had, too. He told me very sternly to not feed it, and it would go away. Naturally, that night after he had gone to bed, I fed the cat a can of tuna. She was very appreciative and affectionate after she had her fill. I repeated this ritual for a few nights and then stealthily purchased some dry cat food which I would hide on the back deck for my new found friend. It didn't take long for my dad to notice that the cat wasn't leaving and no longer looked malnourished. He said I could keep feeding her but that he wasn't taking any responsibility for the cat. I named her Accio after the Harry Potter spell because I would stand on the back porch and shout, "Accio, kitty!" and she would come running. Despite my best efforts that winter, Accio refused to become an indoor cat and lived her life in the wild. She would get under the house and sleep on duct work to keep warm and had her fill of mice. Sadly, after a head injury and another attempt to keep her inside had failed, Accio did what wild animals do and found a quiet place to cross the rainbow bridge last year. She was, by far, the most affectionate cat I have ever had the pleasure of keeping.</p>

      <h2>Kahlua</h2>
      Continuing my love for calico cats, my wife and I adopted Kahlua (aka Kallie) in the winter of 2019. Actually, I lied to my wife and told her I hadn't heard anything about the adoption paperwork we had filled out and then surprised her by bringing home Kallie one day. The shelter profile for Kallie said she had been feral for the first four years of her life and at the shelter for one year. They also said she did not like being petted. We figured a more independent cat would be great for us since we both work full time. The shelter lied. Kallie will bite you if you do not show her enough love and affection. Kallie's hobbies include bathing in the sun, yelling at us through the bedroom door at 5:30am because that's when she thinks breakfast should be, and beating up her little sister, <a href= #pebbles>Pebbles</a>.<br><br>

      <h2>Pebbles</h2>
      Ah, Spring 2020. My wife and I were bored and in quarantine when we thought, "hey, since this thing may go on for a couple months, we should get a kitten!" As luck would have it, a friend of my sister's had a barn cat who had just delivered a litter of kittens who were in need of homes! My wife and I went to the farm and, guess what kind of kittens they had?? That's right, calico! Now, our reasoning behind getting a calico kitten this time was because they are more than likely female and we didn't want a male cat spraying everywhere. My wife first picked up a scared, timid little kitten and I (sometimes regretfully), said we should get the one that was a little more active. We brought the kitten home a couple weeks later and initially named her Tequila (Tiki for short). The name didn't stick. We then thought about Pickles, which lead us to Pebbles, and the name stuck. Pebbles is affectionately refered to as "Crackhead". Her hobbies include scaling walls, opening cat-proof containers to get food, helping me with coding, and bullying <a href="#kallie">Kallie</a> out of her food.<br><br>

      <h1>Dogs</h1>

      <p><article class = "Bud" id = "bud"><h2>Bud</h2>
      Bud (legal name, Budweiser) was technically not my dog but he was an integral part of my childhood. Bud belonged to my sister; he was a birthday present from her husband after Bud had been found abandoned near their house. Bud absolutely <b>loved</b> beer. Specifically, he loved Budweiser beer - hence, his name. When my sister divorced, Bud came to live with my parents and me (plus <a href=#callieholly>Callie &amp; Holly</a>). Bud and the cats tolerated each other well enough. My family thoroughly believes, to this day, that Bud was part human. Bud also loved popsicles in the summer, snuggling behind my mom on her favorite chair, and taking naps with me on the couch. Much to my dismay, when my sister and her husband remarried, Bud went back to live with them and his rottweiler brother, Yukon.<br><br>

      <br><p><article class = "Malibu" id = "malibu"><h2>Malibu</h2>
      The greatest emotional attachment I ever formed to an animal was my baby Malibu. In 2003, I was diagnosed with a cyst in my brain and, after a few months of uncertainty surrounding my MRI, was told that my condition was not going to require surgery. After the confirming appointment at BJC, my parents and I went to Chesterfield Mall and found the pet store was having a sale on puppies. This is where we met Malibu. Malibu was the kindest, most gentle dog I have ever loved. She was easily trained (quite a feat for a beagle), loved people, and helped guide me through some of the most difficult times in my life. Malibu was also very polite; one of her commands was to say "please" before receiving a treat and she would let out a gentle "woof". In 2014, Malibu's heart, which had loved so much and so unconditionally, gave out and she crossed the rainbow bridge with me at her side, telling her how much I loved her. I will forever miss her and I keep some of her ashes in a nip-sized bottle of Malibu rum (after which she was named).<br><br>
